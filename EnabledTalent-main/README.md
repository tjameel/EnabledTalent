## 📌 Project Overview
**Enabled Talent** is a professional mentorship platform designed to bridge the gap between disabled professionals and inclusive employer partnerships. This project focuses on high-quality UX, accessibility, and a modern design system. I have ensured that the interface fully aligns with the Figma brand guidelines and functions seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 🎨 Design System (Figma Implementation)
The interface was rebuilt to follow a cohesive and professional design language:

* **Color Palette:**
    * **Brand Orange:** `#f59e0b` — Primary CTA color and active navigation state.
    * **Light Blue:** `#f0f7ff` — Used for Hero sections and Talent cards.
    * **Light Tan:** `#fff9f0` — Used for Employer cards to provide visual distinction.
    * **Pill Gray:** `#f3f4f6` — Secondary button color.
* **Typography:** High-contrast `text-black` used throughout to meet WCAG accessibility standards.
* **Shapes:** Modern `40px` rounded corners for major cards and `rounded-full` pill shapes for buttons.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Responsive Navigation:** A custom Navbar featuring a centered layout for desktop and a functional "Hamburger" menu for mobile/tablet users.
* **Figma Logo Integration:** Official EnabledTalent brand asset implementation.
* **Alternating Benefit Cards:** Content sections utilize alternating `#f0f7ff` and `#fff9f0` backgrounds with radial-gradient dot grids.
* **CTA Workflow:** Strategically placed "Start Mentoring" and "Apply to be a Mentee" buttons to drive user engagement.
* **Accessibility-First:** Focused on high-contrast text ratios and semantic HTML landmarks.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Icons/Assets:** Custom PNG Assets & SVG Icons
